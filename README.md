# Getting Started with PHP MVC Framework - project1_nhom11
This project was bootstrapped with PHP-Server
Introduction
Why should you use this tool instead of a "real" web server?
Since version 5.4, PHP provides a built-in web server that can be quite useful as a lighweight and dead-easy-to-install development web server. With it, you do not have to install and configure Apache, NGINX or any other web server on your machine, just to be able to view local static websites or PHP web sites/applications.
With PHP-Server, that embedded server becomes even more practical and simpler to use, making it a suitable replacement of a "real" web server, capable enough for most of your PHP development needs.
Features
This tool:
1.	Is much more lightweight on system resources than a common web server.
2.	Is much simpler to install than a web server + PHP integration.
3.	Provides a set of commands to make it easier to control PHP's built-in web server.
4.	Runs the server on the background by default (it doesn't block your terminal, you can even close it).
5.	Can start the server automatically when you log in to your computer.
6.	Allows you to browse all your local websites and directories.
7.	Extends the server's functionality with:
i.	A custom router that:
a.	Auto-generates directory index pages for URLs that match directories having no index.php or index.html files, allowing you to browse your directory structure in search of sites to open.
b.	Supports "virtual URLs" (aka "clean URLs" or "vanity URLs") by automatically redirecting virtual paths to the application's index.php, where it can be further routed.
ii.	Access to your environment variables from PHP scripts
